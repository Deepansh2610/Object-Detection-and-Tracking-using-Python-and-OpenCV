# Object-Detection-and-Tracking-using-Python-and-OpenCV
This is a project in which a python script is ran on the video sample and then the objects are detected in the video sample and also tracked till the end of the frame. Using the simple method of ROI region of interest and mask filters the model was able to accurately identify the cars and bikes on the road. This model is highly accurate only for stable cameras and videos. When the camera starts to move the model becomes inaccurate.
